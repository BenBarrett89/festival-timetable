> A React component for rendering festival timetables

## Purpose
I have attended [Download Festival](https://downloadfestival.co.uk/) for many years now and each year I always have to make my own spreadsheet of the bands that are on each of the stages at any given time, as I am too cheap to buy a Â£10 laminated lanyard.
It also seems that the festival organisers seem to make it their mission to make the stage time information less and less easy to access each year (pressumably on purpose to sell lanyards and get people to use their app - however I do not carry my phone in the arena since my phone was stolen a few years ago).

I intend on creating a React component library for allowing the presentation of stage time information.
I am using this as a learning experience for completing [this series of tutorials by Alan B Smith](https://hackernoon.com/building-a-react-component-library-part-1-d8a1e248fe6c) on building and publishing an npm module.


## Inspiration
The design will be inspired by Japanese festival timetables such as this from the first day of [Rock in Japan 2016](http://rijfes.jp/2016/):

<img src="http://img2.rijfes.jp.s3.amazonaws.com/2016/img/timetable/0719cza/0806.png" alt="Rock in Japan 2016" width="45%" style="float:left">

Or this from [Dead Pop Festival 2017](http://www.deadpopfest.com/):

<img src="http://www.deadpopfest.com/images2017/dpf_2017_tt.jpeg" alt="Dead Pop Festival 2017" width="45%" style="float:left">

I think this is a great way to display the timetable and if it was interactive, perhaps like [this MetRock 2017 timetable](http://metrock.jp/artist/timetable/osaka13.html), it might be even better.

## Ideas
* Should display timetable
* Should be saveable (as an image or PDF) or printable
* Should be interactive - hover shows bands on at the given time?
